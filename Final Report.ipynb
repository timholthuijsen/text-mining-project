The
purpose
of
this
study is develop
a
method
to
generate
recipes
given
a
few
ingredients
using
text
mining.The
model is trained
on
data
of
cooking
recipe
websites.

{Introduction}

To
combat
food
waste and inspire
people
with recipe ideas we thought of creating a recipe generator.The algorithm will train on a database of existing food recipes.The user will input the ingredients that he / she has left in their fridge.Accordingly, the recipe generator will generate a recipe with these ingredients.Possibly, dietary preferences such as vegetarianism, gluten-free or similar can be incorporated.The model will be trained on a recipe database, and accordingly learn combinations and portions of ingredients that work well together.

{Data
preprocessing - separating
recipes}
Initially
the
data
was
one
chunk
of
unseparated
text.As
each
recipe
started
with the the words "EACH PORTION" each dataset was split at the capitalized word "EACH".Afterwards, subsections from the recipes were subtracted and stored as columns in a separate CSV file, subsections include "EACH PORTION", "TEMPERATURE", "METHODstr", "METHOD", "NOTE", "CONTAINS", "INGREDIENTS".
.\\ The
method
was
turned
into
a
string and stored
under
"METHODstr".If
the
string
contained
an
ingredient
form
the
list
of
ingredients, the
ingredient
was
stored in "CONTAINS".For
ingredients
containing
spacing, tokening
the
text
was
an
issue(e.g.
"olive oil", would
come
out as "olive" and "oil" in the
ingredient
list.) Therefore,
for ingredients containing spacing, the space as removed.("olive oil" to "oliveoil") The tokenizer used was...
The
tokenized
method
section
was
tagged
with a POS-tagger.(explain which on this is -> berke's first file) The POS-tag for words contained in the list of ingredients was changed from "NOUN" to "INGREDIENT".

The set of element in the "CONTAINS" section was stored under "INGREDIENTS" to remove repetition of ingredients in the ingredient list.

\subsection{Data preprocessing - method}
We needed to distinguish between ingredients and other nouns before applying co-occurences.

Manually some words have been removed from the recipe list.As we used the function "contain", which checks if a substring is contained in a string, small substrings interfered with the ingredient extraction.(e.g "pea" is contained in "peacefully" ) Also, colours were removed as they seemed to interfere with ingredient extraction as they more often described how to prepare the food instead of the ingredient itself.(e.g stir until brown.) After checking the list of ingredients of length less than 3, strings containing less than 3 characters have been removed.Most words were gibberish, but some have been saved  (e.g."oil", "egg").

\subsection{Co-occurences}
In order to find correlation between ingredients (per recipe), we itated through the ingredient column in the recipes csv and created a contextual co-occurence frequency table of ingredients.A counter saved ingredient pairs. \ \
        \ \
        In order to find correlation between an ingredient and verb, we looked at the POS-tagged method focusing on the tag "VERB".For words in the spansize two the for loop added ingredient-verb pairs to the counter.In order to do this, we filtered for the POS-tag "INGREDIENT".
\subsection{LSTM}
We used an LSTM Recurrent Neural Network for text generation. \ \

        - why did you decide to use this method?
